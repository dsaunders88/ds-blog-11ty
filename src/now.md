I’m Daniel Saunders, a Midwesterner in Los Angeles. This site is meant to be a (probably infrequent) chronicle of the things I’m reading and thinking about.

## Projects

My biggest project at the moment is a deep dive into front end web development (you’re looking at some of the fruits of that now!), which is part of a general move I’ve been making as a freelance worker from visual and print design to web design. I’ve used <a href="https://webflow.com/" target="_blank">Webflow</a> for a long time (and it’s a great tool), but I reached the point where I wanted more flexibility, control, and understanding of the things I was making. It’s been a long process and has taken me through refreshing HTML and CSS fundamentals, learning JavaScript, and adopting new tools like Visual Studio Code, the command line, npm packages, <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank">TailwindCSS</a>, and <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank">Eleventy</a> (<a href="https://learneleventyfromscratch.com/lesson/31.html#the-end" target="_blank">I learned Eleventy from scratch!</a>) for static site generation (because the future is <a href="https://jamstack.org/" target="_blank">Jamtack</a>). Honestly, it’s made me a better designer, too. I’ve got a lot to learn, but it’s been a blast so far.

I’m slowly working on a top secret personal design project that combines typography, web development, reading, and communism. See <a href="https://twitter.com/dothedan/status/1492280983181135874?cxt=HHwWhMCoubrp0rUpAAAA" target="_blank">more about that here</a>, and stay tuned...

In my freelance work I’ve recently designed and deployed some websites that I’m particularly proud of, two of them Episcopal churches: <a href="https://www.stjohnsla.org/" target="_blank">St. John’s Cathedral</a> in Los Angeles and <a href="https://www.trinitynewton.org/" target="_blank">Trinity Parish</a> in the Boston area.

## Reading & Writing

- To commemorate the publication centenary of _Ulysses_, I’m going through the novel for the second time (last time was ~10 years ago) with the help of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30339.Ulysses" target="_blank">Hugh Kenner’s incredible critical guide</a>.

- Revisiting some of the novels and biography of the Greek writer Nikos Kazantzakis for an essay I’m working on.

- Finished Olúfẹ́mi O. Táíwò's excellent new book, <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/reconsidering-reparations-9780197508893?cc=us&lang=en&" target="_blank"><em>Reconsidering Reparations</em></a>, and will have a review of it coming out soon.

- Recently read and enjoyed Alex Ross’ <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374285937/wagnerism" target="_blank"><em>Wagnerism: Art and Politics in the Shadow of Music</em></a>, Vine Deloria, Jr.’s <a href="https://www.oupress.com/9780806121291/custer-died-for-your-sins/" target="_blank"><em>Custer Died for Your Sins: An Indian Manifesto</em></a>, Max Ajl’s <a href="https://www.plutobooks.com/9780745341750/a-peoples-green-new-deal/" target="_blank"><em>A People's Green New Deal</em></a>, and William Clare Roberts’ <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691180816/marxs-inferno" target="_blank"><em>Marx's Inferno: The Political Theory of Capital</em></a>.

- Otherwise kind of a dry season for reading, but things I’ve always got on the backburner: Marx’s _Grundrisse_, all of the exciting new secondary works on Marx (i.e., Michael Heinrich’s <a href="https://monthlyreview.org/product/how-to-read-marxs-capital/" target="_blank"><em>How to Read Marx’s Capital</em></a>), and Robert Alter’s three-volume translation of the <a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393292497" target="_blank">Hebrew Bible</a>.
